The overall goal of Spellbound is to offer players more say on their own path through the world of magic. From a
variety of spells, upgrades, radial options and more, players will have a choice in how their spells progress and how
they can interact with the world around them

- Spell Acquisition:
    - Spells from each path are acquired through different means that match the theme of the provided path.
    - Adds gameplay options and replayability through mini boss/boss battles, structures, and biome/dimension
        exploration.

    - Ruin:
        - Scattered across the overworld are Dormant Ruin Portals. Just like vanilla Ruined Portals, these portals will
            always be found with blocks missing. These blocks missing blocks can either be found in dungeons or traded
            for Arcanthus with the Elder Magi

        - To activate these portals, Magi's must use a keystone that corresponds with the spell they wish to receive.
            Keystones will be a mix of Arcanthus and Stone. Spell specific keystones are crafted by mixing the
            necessary materials with the keystone.

        - Activating and entering these portals takes Magi's to themed battle arena that vary with the sub path of the
            desired spell, as well as the difficulty of the battle (which scales with the strength of the spell). Each
            sub path has will have 3 bosses, scaling from early, to mid, to late game.

        - Upon defeating the boss, all players are transported out the arena, the portal is closed, and the desired
            spell tome is dropped. However, if the player who activated the portal dies or leaves the arena for
            whatever reason, all players are transported out and the portal closes with no reward.

    - Transfiguration:
        - Scattered across the biomes, you can find Enchanted Pools. They can be found as high as mountain biomes and
            as low as the Ancient City.

        - Each biome gives a slight variation to the effect/color of these pools.

        - Taking a dip will reinforce your mana, giving you +5% to spell potency and +30 mana for 1 minute. This can
            also be picked up by bucket to be transported to a Magi's base, or bottled up and taken on adventures.
            Drinking the bottle gives the same effect as taking a swim.

        - Placing the Enchanted Pool liquid will have it take the effect of whatever biome it is placed in.

        - Throwing in the right combination of items with some Arcanthus in the pool in the appropriate biome will
            result in a Transfiguration spell tome.

    - Summon:
        - Located deep in the nether, Magi's can find Ruined Summon Circles.

        - At these structures, there are inactive summon blocks arranged in a circle with a centerpiece missing.

        - Activating these summon circles will open a portal to a themed arena where the players must defeat the summon
            to receive the spell tome.

        - To activate the portal, Magi's fill in the center block with their desired marked summon block and must
            right-click all unactivated blocks with Arcanthus.

        - Upon defeating the summon, all players in the arena are transported back to summon circle, the spell tome is
            dropped and the center block is destroyed. However, if the Magi who activated the center block dies in the
            arena or leaves for any reason, the trial is forfeited, all players are transported back to the summon
            circle and the center block is destroyed.

    - Divine:
        - Located in Overworld biomes, Magi's can find Divine Temples of different variations.

        - In the center of these temples, guarded by a Valkyr, a divine guardian, are Divine Shrines.

        - Shrines can be mined with a diamond pickaxe or higher to be taken to a Magi's base for decor or utility.

        - Shrines can be activated once a day with Arcanthus to grant the user a random temporary buff (if a buff is
            not already active).

        - To obtain divine spells, players must perform a divine actions that correspond with the spell within a
            50-block radius of an activated shrine.

    - Deception:
        - Found underground in all vanilla dimensions, Magi's can find Sealed Puzzle Dungeons. These dungeons can be
            found either by using a Puzzle Map (traded with an Elder Magi) or by using Arcane Eyes (Ender Pearls mixed
            with Arcanthus).

        - These dungeons hold both bountiful loot and deadly traps.

        - Dungeons can have 1 - 3 connected puzzle rooms, each with vary difficulty.

        - Successfully solving the puzzle in one of these rooms will result in a bounty, which will always result in a
            Deception spell tome that matches the theme of the puzzle. However, failed attempts will result in magical
            traps that scale with the difficulty of the room.

        - To avoid player griefing or cheese mechanics, no room or puzzle will be redstone powered and loot will
            dramatically appear in the center of the room


- Path Uniqueness:
    - Each path will have certain aspects that are unique and specific to them, giving paths more purpose and offering
        more gameplay options.
    - Adds amulets for ruin, divine, and deception the player can wear to view the build up of these effects

    - Ruin: Contains subpaths, most with respective status effects that players can proc after receive a certain amount
            of damage.
            - Subpaths:
                - Elementalist - Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Shock
                - Misc - Arcane, Poison, Blood, Disease

    - Transfiguration: Effects, entities, and layers change based on the biome

    - Summon: Offers familiars that scale with the path level. Can persist after death and travel with the player
                between dimension. Can be customized.

    - Divine: Players receive divine judgement. The more good actions and positive energy spells they use, the more
                potent they become. However, this also decreases the potency of negative energy spells. Likewise, the
                more negative actions and negative energy spells the player uses, the more potent they become, reducing
                the potency of positive spells.

    - Deception: Successfully getting hit by these spells slowly fills up their Hallucination meter. Once full, a
                    random hallucinatory effect takes place.

                    Mode, will occasionally fly up to survey the area, highlighting any mob or player in an 8-block
                    radius. By default, will just fly around the player and hoot when mobs are approaching.

- Summon Mob Battles:
    - Giant Spider:
        - Destructible eggs spawn in arena, hatch into spiders if not destroyed in time


- Deception Puzzles:
    - Shadow Veil - Hall of Darkness
        - Upon activating the Deception Altar, the player is given the Darkness effect and statues holding unlit
            torches are scattered throughout the room

        - Along with statues are Shadow Watchers who patrol the room (with very minimal line of sight). They can only
            see players if they move in bright areas, move too close, or too quickly

        - To successfully solve the puzzle, the player must light all torches without being seen in a set amount of
            time.

        - Failing to light the torches in time or being seen by a Watcher will result in alerting all Watchers in the
            room of your presence, instantly pulling aggro

    - Doppelg√§nger - Hall of Reflections
        - Upon activating the Deception Altar, clones of the player appear around them

        - Each clone has a slightly different appearance, with only one perfectly matching the player's appearance

        - To successfully solve this puzzle, for 5 waves, the player must interact with the correct clone in a set
            amount of time. Each wave increases the amount of clones added and decreases the amount of time.

        - Failed attempts cause the clones to come to life to attack the player

    - Purge Magic - Hall of Nullification
        - Upon activating the Deception alter, a 2x2 glyph appears above the entrance of the hall. Along with the glyph
            are about a dozen floating, glowing orbs (cubes) each with a symbol on them.

        - To successfully solve this puzzle, the player must collide with the proper orbs that match the symbols on the
            glyph. Colliding with the correct orb will remove a symbol from the glyph and remove the glow from the orb.

        - Touching an incorrect orb will turn it and the glyph red, summoning two small runic constructs, having high
            resistance to physical and projectile attacks. Any player seen by these constructs are silenced. The puzzle
            will not activate again until these constructs are killed.
